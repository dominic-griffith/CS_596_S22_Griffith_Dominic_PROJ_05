Project 5, Augmented Reality,  100 pts

 

For the fifth individual project you will be making a mobile / cross platform Augmented Reality Game. You may use the Unity Foundations Github Example repository as a starting point. The repository is at https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples (Links to an external site.) .  

For this assignment you will make a clone of the arfoundation codebase and rename the project as follows: CS_596_S22_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_Proj_05.

Here are a list of requirements for the project:

Your AR game should be playable on your personal phone
Your AR game shall 
Detect a flat surface, and render the surface detected in the live video window
Spawn three stacked cubes on the detected surface
Allow the player to shoot the stacked cubes with a bullet (fourth game object).
Your AR game may use touch input to adjust the power, angle, and firing of the bullet game object.
Extra credit for using your phones accelerometer to move the position of the cannon ( instead of the arrow keys as in the original game). 
 

Both Undergraduate and Graduate students will earn 10 extra points for building using phonesâ€™ accelerometers .
